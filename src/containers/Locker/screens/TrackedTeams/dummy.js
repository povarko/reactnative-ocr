His previous deal was set to expire at the end of this current season. In July, the club had announced an agreement was in the works, but it took four months for the Argentine superstar to agree to financial terms.",

His previous deal was set to expire at the end of this current season. In July, the club had announced an agreement was in the works, but it took four months for the Argentine superstar to agree to financial terms.",

          "After months of speculation, Lionel Messi inked a new contract with FC Barcelona on Saturday morning that commits him to Camp Nou through the 2020-21 season when he is 34-years old. His previous deal was set to expire at the end of this current season. In July, the club had announced an agreement was in the works, but it took four months for the Argentine superstar to agree to financial terms.",
