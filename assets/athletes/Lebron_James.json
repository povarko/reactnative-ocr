He joined the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2003 as the first overall draft pick. James quickly emerged as a league star and concluded his first season by winning the NBA Rookie of the Year Award. He would go on to establish himself as one of the premier players in the NBA with multiple accolades, including being given the NBA Most Valuable Player Award in 2009 and 2010. However, after falling short of the championship expectations set by the media, fans, and himself, James departed Cleveland in 2010 as a free agent to sign with the Miami Heat. This move was announced in an ESPN special titled The Decision, and is one of the most controversial free agent decisions in American sports history."

James says he enjoys going to a variety of workout classes to stay in shape.\nIn particular, the King says he enjoys versaclimber classes, which are popular in Los Angeles and essentially is workout on a step climber. He also practices pilates and enjoys spin classes.

Reports out of Minnesota this offseason have made it clear Butler is unhappy with the his current situation. He has grown frustrated with Karl Anthony-Towns and Andrew Wiggins as well as his current financial state. What is surprising, however, is Butler’s preference in teams: the Clippers, Knicks and Nets with Los Angeles taking the top spot on his list."

      "text": "Among active NBA players, the only one who has even a shot at contesting Michael Jordan’s status as the Greatest of All Time is LeBron James. Deep into his 15th season in the league, LeBron today matched Jordan’s regular season record of 866 consecutive games with double-digit points on the way to leading the Cleveland Cavaliers to a 118-105 win over the Charlotte Hornets.\nHaving solidified his status as the best player of this decade, James is leading a rejuvenated Cavaliers squad to the 3rd seed in the Eastern Conference this year while putting up 27.4 points, 8.6 rebounds and 9.1 assists per game. In terms of counting numbers, only Russell Westbrook is better than him this year!\nMichael Jordan also played 15 (albeit not full) seasons in the league like James, so this is probably the best time to gauge who is the greatest of all time. To do that, we are strictly using statistics as our basis here."
