It’s where elite mixed martial arts (MMA) athletes meet to test themselves, and 145-pound champion Conor McGregor is leading the charge.\nThere’s something unique about McGregor. He has an aura surrounding him that makes everything he touches turn to gold in the sport of MMA. He’s got an energy like Arnold Schwarzenegger had when he stepped into the gym, or when Michael Jordan took to the basketball court. He’s known as “The Notorious” for a reason."
