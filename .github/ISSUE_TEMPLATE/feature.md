# Description

Leave a short description of the issue here (e.g. Integrate Charts API to Backend)

# Details

Leave a detailed description of the issue here, if relevant. If integrating a backend API, paste links to the API docs of them. If the API doesn't exist, add a link to the issue in the repo to create it (or if none exists, write TBD), then add the blocked label. If adding app behavior, describe how the screens update when different actions happen. Describe what happens on edge cases (no internet connection, error response, etc)

# Tests

Note test cases that should be satisfied by the issue here:

- e.g. Sending positive value number from authenticated user gives success message
- e.g. Chart is empty when no data is returned from server, and has generated chart when data is (use mock for api)
