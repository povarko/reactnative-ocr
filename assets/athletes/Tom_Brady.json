Due to his late draft selection, Brady is considered to be the biggest “steal” in the history of the NFL Draft In Brady’s sixteen seasons as a starter,[a] he has quarterbacked the Patriots to eight Super Bowl appearances, the most for any player in history. Brady is also one of only two quarterbacks to win the Super Bowl in their first season as a starter, the other being Kurt Warner."

By the end of the night, one thing was clear — we aren’t likely to see two quarterback performances like this in the same game again any time soon.\nPatrick Mahomes, the rising star with the weight of NFL nation’s expectations on his shoulders, played fearlessly all night – breaking the game open with one big play after another in a wild second half that helped us easily forget an uncharacteristically difficult first-half for the sophomore QB."
